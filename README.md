Assignment: CSS Hell
====================
Changes made: 
- left and right margins changed to 2.5 so text is wider on the page
- added background image as the cover image of the book so it matches the theme of the book
- changed header 1,2,3,4 and 5 fonts to Garamond, serif witha bold weight
- from h1-h5 made font sizes progresively smaller
- for paragraphs, added a 1 indent on the first line, a top and bottom margin and the font family is Garamond, serif
- for the fig tag which is the image tag on the html, added a border which contains text
- the text in the fig tag is the caption which is italic and center aligned (no indent)
- for address links, changed hover, visited and link colours
- also added a thick black order on every image ot make it pop from the background
- added a body border to encase the whole webpage

- ** I could not figure out how to have the background show up when you save the webpage and it's assets. 
- Only way I could make it work is going into firefox f12 settings and changing it to the style sheet in the github repo
