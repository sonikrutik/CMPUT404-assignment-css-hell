                After 3 and a half years of being in the Bachelors of Computing Science at the University of Alberta, I 
                have gained skills on all different levels of programming. From developing data structures and shells in 
                the lower levels of programming like C, to developing systems that interact with SQL databases at the higher 
                levels of programming with Python. I am also learning how the internet works learning HTML, CSS and internet 
                protocols from the ground up currently. This past summer I got the oppportuniy to work at Alberta Health Services
                helping them with the entire software development process. I got excellent experience in developing and deploying test
                documentation and cases to users. I also had the oppportuniy to work with their databases to develop new tables that are 
                to be used with new front end fields that were being deployed to provide users to create specialized reports.

                Outside of school, I enjoy playing games with friends and finding new places to try food. 
                Right now I am playing through Need for Speed: Heat and 
                I am pretty excited to try the new NFS game.

            <p>
                As myself, I offer someone who is very interested in figuring out how to design things 
                that work well together. Designing something that anyone can open and understand the use of
                is something I strive to create. I also like to design and create things that 
                are pleasing and fluent to look at. I like to take on new tasks and be provided with 
                tasks that I can learn from and grow my skills. I am someone who enjoys feedback and am 
                not afraid to ask questions after giving it my best shot at solving something.
